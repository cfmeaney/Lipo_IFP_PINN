This repo contains data and sample code from our publication:

INSERT PUBLICATION LINK

The code is easily adaptable, and more details can be found in the accompanying publication.

The Python version used was 3.7.6. The requirements.txt file gives the packages required to run the code.

The Mouse Inputs folder contains the processed mouse data used in the study. The raw data is far too large to upload, as is the processed version of the data for mouse_04. Please email me if you are interested in the raw data or mouse_04.

The IRK_weights for the possible q values selected in the code can be found at https://github.com/cfmeaney/brain_tumour_PINN.

The Run_Mouse.py file contains the script to run the analysis for a mouse data file. All results in the paper are variations of this base code.
